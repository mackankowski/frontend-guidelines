## Colaboration

The content of this repository is a result of teams cooperation and it wouldn't be the same form without other people. As it's result working together, I cannot imagine that the further developing woudld be any different. What follow next, as an open source paradigm, I would love to hear the voice of you and an active cooperation from any of us. Thank you!
