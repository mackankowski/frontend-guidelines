This repository containes coding guidelines for Frontent (JavaScript) developers. It describes recommended toolset and its configuration too. Just best practices here! 

## Colaboration

The content of this repository is a result of teams cooperation and it wouldn't be the same form without other developers. As it is result working together, I cannot imagine that the further developing would exist without the community. Following an open source principles, I would love to hear the voice of you and expecting an active cooperation. Thank you!
